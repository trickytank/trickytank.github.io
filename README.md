# About me

<img style="float: right;" src="14-Fake-Ecologist-Cropped-as-Headshot-mini.jpg" alt="Rick Tankard head shot" width="33%" height="33%" style="padding: 5%;">

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Mathematics and Statistics department of Murdoch University, Australia. 
I currently am interested in applying statistical methods to analyse high-throughput biological data.

I studied statistics and history & philosophy of science during undergraduate studies. 
After working as a research technician for two years, I then undertook a Bioinformatics PhD project (not yet awarded) at The Walter + Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and The University of Melbourne, where I investigated the ability of next-generation sequencing to detect disease-causing repeat expansions. 
This resulted in the development of an R software package [exSTRa](https://github.com/bahlolab/exSTRa/).
