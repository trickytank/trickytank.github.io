# About me

I am a Bioinformatician and Statistician based in Australia. 
I am leaving academia for now and seeking work in health and medical industries.

My LinkedIn profile is currently a work in progress https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricktankard/. 
Please message me on LinkedIn if you would like to see my CV.

I studied statistics and history & philosophy of science during undergraduate studies. 
After working as a research technician for two years, I then undertook a Bioinformatics PhD project at The Walter + Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and The University of Melbourne, where I investigated the ability of next-generation sequencing to detect disease-causing repeat expansions. 
This resulted in the development of an R software package [exSTRa](https://github.com/bahlolab/exSTRa/).
